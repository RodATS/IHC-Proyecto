<h2>Shoulder Physical Therapy Project using AR</h2>

In the field of physical therapy, the convergence of technologies has given rise to quite interesting innovation. The Augmented Reality Physical Therapy Assistant is a revolutionary application that combines the power of Magic Leap v1 and Kinect to offer patients a unique rehabilitation experience.

This application is designed to allow patients to carry out therapeutic exercises in an augmented reality environment. Magic Leap v1 technology overlays virtual elements onto your real environment, creating a completely new interaction space. Meanwhile, the Kinect, with its high-precision motion tracking capability, monitors and analyzes the patient's every movement, providing instant, personalized feedback.

So, although in the real world there is already a physical therapy process as such, we seek to take it to the next level, using the latest technologies to make a therapy process much more comfortable and more effective.

In this work, we will explain this innovative therapeutic solution in detail, describing its functionality, advantages and potential impact on patients' healthcare and quality of life. In addition, the technical aspects, challenges and future prospects of the Augmented Reality Physical Therapy Assistant will be analyzed, highlighting its ability to revolutionize physical rehabilitation and improve the recovery process of patients around the world.
